<h1>About InterMine</h1>

<p>InterMine was formed in 2002 at the University of Cambridge, originally as a Drosophila-dedicated resource, before expanding to become organism-agnostic, enabling a large range of organisations around the world to create their own InterMines. The InterMine team is part of <a href="">Micklem lab</a>, headed by Gos Micklem.</p>
