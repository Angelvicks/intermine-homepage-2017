### Contributing to InterMine

If you'd like to contribute to InterMine, here are a few ways to get started: 

 - Look at [InterMine issues](https://github.com/intermine/intermine/issues) and [BlueGenes Issues](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/issues)
   - Issues marked "good first bug" and "hacktoberfest" ([more about Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)) are good places to start.
   - Mention on the ticket that you'd like to make a start so no-one else picks it up! 
   - Read through our [contributing guidelines](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/get-involved/) before making any pull requests. 
   - When you think it's ready, make a PR and bask in glory!
 - Need more help, or have an idea? Drop us an email or come visit in chat. We'd love to hear from you! 
 - If you're a student, you could consider applying for [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) - applications open in March.
